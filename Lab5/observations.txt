Step 1: Explain what happens when you run the threadSync.c program? How does this program differ from the
threadHello.c program?
    When the program threadSync is ran we see that each of the 0 - N threads cannot run unless the other thread is out of the critical seciton. This is crucial because it demonstrates the use of synchronization and semaphores in this implementation.
